MCollective Puppet module
-------------------------

Currently this module also includes some plugins from the mcollective-plugins module.

These will soon be removed though, to prevent them getting out of date.

They will be replaced with a sub-module to the official mcollective-plugins repo at:

  http://github.com/ripienaar/mcollective-plugins

Be warned in other words - plugin management will be changing, as the current 
implementation is a bit shonky.
